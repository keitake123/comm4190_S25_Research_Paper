# COMM4190 Spring 2025 - Research Project

## Overview

This research project explores the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the legal profession, specifically their use in legal advice and documentation. The project will examine the opportunities and challenges posed by LLMs, such as GPT-4, in automating routine legal tasks, streamlining workflows, and providing legal advice to individuals who cannot afford traditional legal services.

The research will analyze both the **theoretical framework and the **practical application of LLMs in legal contexts. I will investigate how LLMs can assist in contract drafting, legal research, and providing basic legal advice, while also addressing the ethical concerns that arise from using AI in such sensitive and complex areas of law. By exploring these issues, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the implications of using LLMs in the legal profession.

## Method

The project will be structured around the following components:

1. Literature Review:
   Conduct a literature review to understand how LLMs are being used in legal practice. This will include exploring legal frameworks, ethical issues (e.g., bias, accountability, confidentiality), and the potential impact of AI on the legal profession.
   
2. Empirical Analysis:  
   Analyze how LLMs can be employed in real-world legal scenarios. The analysis will focus on practical examples, such as generating settlement agreements or providing basic legal advice through AI-driven platforms like DoNotPay.
   
3. Ethical Review and Risk Assessment:  
   Assess the ethical implications of using LLMs in legal work, including concerns related to data privacy, bias in legal advice in the legal sector.

4. Practical Application:  
   Perform an experiment by using ChatGPT to simulate legal document creation. This will involve generating a settlement agreement for a car accident case to explore the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in drafting legally sound documents. The results will be compared to traditional human-produced legal documents.

## Deliverables

- Final Paper: A comprehensive research paper in Markdown format, summarizing the literature review, empirical analysis, and ethical considerations.
- Annotated Bibliography: A list of key academic sources that informed the research.
- Simulation Data: A collection of simulated legal documents and the corresponding outputs from both LLMs and human legal experts, including settlement agreements and basic legal advice.
  
## Research Goals

This research aims to:

1. Examine the role of LLMs in improving the efficiency and accessibility of legal services.
2. Analyze the ethical concerns of using LLMs for legal advice and documentation.
3. Assess the potential impact of LLMs on job security in the legal profession and their effect on legal expertise.
4. Provide recommendations on how LLMs can be ethically integrated into legal practice to enhance service delivery without compromising professional integrity.
