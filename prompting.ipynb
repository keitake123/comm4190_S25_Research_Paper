    "This part ensures the payment you receive is structured the way you want and protects you if the other driver misses payments. Here are some questions to help clarify your needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you have a specific payment schedule or total settlement amount in mind?\n",
    "- What length of time is acceptable for the payments to be completed?\n",
    "- How do you want to handle missed or late payments? For example, do you want interest, penalties, or the right to take immediate legal action?\n",
